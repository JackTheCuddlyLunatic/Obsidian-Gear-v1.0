This mod adds a new set of tools and armor into the game that are made of obsidian. They're meant to be pre-hellstone bar gear, and to make it easier for players to obtain the molten set, without requiring the player to fight the Eater of Worlds or the Brain of Cthulu.

I got reeeeeaaaaaally bored.
